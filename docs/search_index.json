So basics knowledge in GIS is expected (simple features, projections and CRS, geometrical operations, etc.). No knowledge of R is required. A minimal knowledge of (R)mardown will be a plus to take notes. Please install R on your system and the following libraries. Please follow installation instructions from the CRAN projet. The {sf} library needs several geospatial core libraries (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ) so please follow {sf} installation instructions to be sure to have those. For Ubuntu users, ThinkR published a blogpost about the installation of r 3 5 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and tips for spatial packages install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) install.packages(&quot;spData&quot;) install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tmap&quot;) install.packages(&quot;cartography&quot;) For OSGeoLive users, there is already most of them installed in the distribution. Please start Jupyter Notebooks (Menu -&gt; GeoSpatial -&gt; Spatial Tools -&gt; Jupyter Notebook). It should open a web page. Click on New in the top right and start a new R Notebook. Then install only the following packages : install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tmap&quot;) install.packages(&quot;cartography&quot;) 1.1 About this document This document had been written with the R Bookdown package and Rstudio. You can use the editor of your choice to follow the instruction, be careful on the path given by the {here} package. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.
